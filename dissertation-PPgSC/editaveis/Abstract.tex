\begin{abstract}
	This document describes the dissertations and theses of \gls{ufrn}'s \gls{ppgsc}, its structure and the reasons that supported some of the choices made. The main goal of this document is to facilitate the writing of documents by the students, and to homogenize their typesetting. This document does not aim to be an introductory guide for those who do not know \LaTeX{}, but it lists references that can be used for those who are novices to the task of writing documents in \LaTeX{} as well as for those who are experienced. The majority of the packets used in the model are briefly described and some examples are included in this document, as well as some examples with the \LaTeX{} code which produces them. This model will be available together with the \LaTeX{} source code used to produce all the figures, tables, algorithms and listings. I propose that you identify the packets you will need and comment out the instructions that load the ones you will not need, thus, reducing the document's processing time, and include packets individually as you detect the need for them.
